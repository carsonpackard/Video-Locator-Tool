[99,"There is a lesson in the Prophet Joseph Smith\u2019s account of the First Vision"],
[105,"which virtually everyone in this audience has had occasion to experience, or one day soon will. I promise you."],
[113,"It is the plain and very sobering truth that before great moments, certainly before great"],
[123,"spiritual moments, there can come adversity, opposition, and darkness."],
[129,"Life has some of those moments for us, and occasionally they come just as we are approaching"],
[137,"an important decision or a significant step in our life."],
[142,"In the marvelous account that we read too seldom, Joseph said he had scarcely begun"],
[150,"his prayer when he felt a power of astonishing influence come over him."],
[156,"Thick darkness, as he described it, gathered around him and seemed bent on his utter destruction."],
[164,"But he exerted all his powers to call upon God to deliver him out of the power of this"],
[175,"enemy, and as he did so a pillar of light brighter than the noonday sun descended gradually"],
[184,"until it rested upon him."],
[187,"At the very moment of the light\u2019s appearance, he found himself delivered from the destructive"],
[195,"power that had held him bound."],
[197,"What then followed is the greatest epiphany since the events surrounding the crucifixion,"],
[204,"resurrection, and ascension of Christ in the meridian of time."],
[209,"The Father and the Son appeared to Joseph Smith, and the dispensation of the fulness"],
[216,"of times had begun."],
[219,"Most of us do not need any more reminders than we have already had that there is one"],
[226,"who personifies \u201copposition in all things,\u201d that \u201can angel of God\u201d fell \u201cfrom heaven\u201d"],
[234,"and in so doing became \u201cmiserable forever.\u201d"],
[239,"What a chilling destiny."],
[242,"Lehi teaches us that because this is Lucifer\u2019s fate, \u201che sought also the misery of all"],
[250,"mankind\u201d . Surely this must be the original ecclesiastical source for the homely little"],
[262,"adage that misery loves company."],
[265,"A morning\u2019s devotional could be devoted to this subject of the adversary\u2019s strong,"],
[272,"preliminary, anticipatory opposition to many of the good things that God has in store for us"],
[282,"But today I want to move past that observation to another truth we may not recognize so readily."],
[290,"This is a lesson in the parlance of the athletic contest that reminds us \u201cit isn\u2019t over"],
[297,"until it\u2019s over.\u201d"],
[299,"It is the reminder that the fight goes on."],
[302,"Unfortunately we must not think that Satan is defeated with that first, strong breakthrough"],
[310,"that so dramatically brings the light and moves us forward."],
[315,"To make my point a little more vividly, may I go to another passage of scripture, indeed"],
[322,"to another vision."],
[323,"You will recall that the book of Moses begins with him being taken up to \u201can exceedingly"],
[330,"high mountain\u201d where, the scripture says, \u201che saw God face to face, and he talked"],
[337,"with him, and the glory of God was upon Moses\u201d."],
[341,"What then followed was what happens to prophets who are taken to high mountains."],
[346,"The Lord said to Moses,"],
[348,"Look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands."],
[352,"And . . . Moses . . . beheld the earth, yea, even all of it; and there was not a particle"],
[358,"of it which he did not behold, discerning it by the spirit of God."],
[362,"And he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and there was not a soul which he beheld not."],
[368,"This experience is remarkable by every standard."],
[372,"It is one of the great revelations given in human history."],
[376,"It stands with the greatest accounts we have of any prophet\u2019s experience with divinity."],
[381,"But Moses\u2019 message to you today is, \u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down.\u201d"],
[390,"Don\u2019t assume that a great revelation, some marvelous illuminating moment, or the opening"],
[396,"of an inspired path is the end of it."],
[400,"Remember, it isn\u2019t over until it\u2019s over."],
[404,"What happened to Moses next, after his revelatory moment, would be ludicrous if it were not"],
[413,"so dangerous and so absolutely true to form."],
[418,"In an effort to continue his opposition, in his unfailing effort to get his licks in later"],
[426,"if not sooner, Lucifer appeared and shouted in equal portions of anger and petulance"],
[435,"after God had revealed himself to the prophet, saying, \u201cMoses, worship me.\u201d"],
[445,"But Moses was not having it."],
[447,"He had just seen the real thing, and by comparison this sort of performance was pretty dismal."],
[457,"Moses looked upon Satan and said: Who art thou?"],
[461,"...where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?"],
[465,"For behold, I could not look upon God, except his glory should come upon me."],
[471,". . . But I can look upon thee in the natural man."],
[475,". . . Where is thy glory, for it is darkness unto me?"],
[479,"And I can judge between thee and God."],
[483,"Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not."],
[488,"The record then depicts a reaction that is both pathetic and frightening."],
[495,"And now, when Moses had said these words, Satan cried with a loud voice, and ranted"],
[502,"upon the earth, and commanded, saying: I am the Only Begotten, worship me."],
[510,"And it came to pass that Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw"],
[518,"the bitterness of hell."],
[520,"Nevertheless, calling upon God [the very phrase used by Joseph Smith], he received strength,"],
[529,"and he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship,"],
[537,"which is the God of glory."],
[540,"And now Satan began to tremble, and the earth shook."],
[544,"And it came to pass that Satan cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and wailing, and"],
[550,"gnashing of teeth; and he departed hence."],
[554,"So Satan left, always to come again, we can be sure, but always to be defeated by the"],
[567,"God of Glory\u2014always."],
[571,"I wish to encourage every one of you today regarding opposition that so often comes after"],
[583,"enlightened decisions have been made, after moments of revelation and conviction have"],
[591,"given us a peace and an assurance we thought we would never lose."],
[595,"In his letter to the Hebrews, the Apostle Paul was trying to encourage new members who"],
[602,"had just joined the Church, who undoubtedly had had spiritual experiences and had received"],
[609,"the pure light of testimony, only to discover that not only had their troubles not ended,"],
[618,"but that some of them had only begun."],
[621,"It reminds me of President Hugh B. Brown\u2019s statement about marriage."],
[625,"He said he had always been told that when he got married he would come to the end of"],
[629,"his troubles."],
[630,"So he got married, only to discover they were speaking about the front end."],
[639,"That&amp;#39;s nervous laughter from returned missionaries. I&amp;#39;ll be back to you before the morning is over."],
[650,"Paul pled with those new members about the way President Hinckley is pleading with new"],
[656,"members today."],
[658,"The reminder is that we cannot sign on for a moment of such eternal significance and"],
[665,"everlasting consequence without knowing it will be a fight\u2014a good fight and a winning"],
[673,"fight, but a fight nevertheless."],
[676,"Paul said to those who thought a new testimony, a personal conversion, or a spiritual baptismal"],
[683,"experience would put them beyond trouble, \u201cCall to remembrance the former days, in"],
[692,"which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions\u201d"],
[700,"Then came this tremendous counsel, which is at the heart of my counsel to you and the"],
[705,"title of my remarks this morning:"],
[707,"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward."],
[717,"For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God,"],
[725,"ye might receive the promise."],
[728,". . . If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."],
[735,". . . We are not of them who draw back unto perdition."],
[743,"In LDS talk that is to say, \u201cSure it is tough\u2014before you join the Church, while"],
[751,"you are trying to join, and after you have joined.\u201d"],
[754,"That is the way it has always been, Paul said, but don\u2019t \u201cdraw back,\u201d he warned."],
[758,"Don\u2019t panic and retreat. Don&amp;#39;t lose your confidence."],
[763,"Don\u2019t forget how you once felt. Don\u2019t distrust the experience you had."],
[770,"That tenacity is what saved Moses when the adversary confronted him,"],
[776,"and it is what will save you."],
[780,"I suppose every returned missionary and probably every convert within the sound of my voice"],
[787,"knows exactly what I am talking about: appointments for discussions canceled, the Book of Mormon"],
[793,"in a plastic bag hanging from a front-door knob, baptismal dates not met."],
[800,"And so it goes through the teaching period, through the commitments, through the baptism,"],
[805,"through the first weeks and months in the Church, and more or less forever."],
[810,"At least the adversary would pursue it forever, if he thought he could see any weakening of"],
[816,"your resolve or any chink in your armor\u2014even if it is after the fact."],
[823,"This opposition turns up almost anyplace something good has happened."],
[831,"It can happen when you are trying to get an education."],
[835,"It can hit you after your first month in your new mission field."],
[839,"It certainly happens in matters of love and marriage."],
[844,"(Now I am back to those returned missionaries.)"],
[847,"I would like to have a dollar for every person in a courtship who knew he or she had felt"],
[856,"the guidance of the Lord in that relationship, had prayed about the experience enough to"],
[861,"know it was the will of the Lord, knew they loved each other and enjoyed each other\u2019s"],
[865,"company, and saw a lifetime of wonderful compatibility ahead\u2014only to panic, to get a brain cramp,"],
[874,"to have total catatonic fear sweep over them."],
[879,"They \u201cdraw back,\u201d as Paul said, if not into perdition at least into marital paralysis."],
[889,"I am not saying you shouldn\u2019t be very careful about something as significant and serious"],
[896,"as marriage."],
[897,"And I certainly am not saying that a young man can get a revelation that he is to marry"],
[902,"a certain person without that young woman getting the same confirmation."],
[906,"I have seen a lot of those one-way revelations in young people\u2019s lives."],
[913,"Yes, there are cautions and considerations to make, but once there has been genuine illumination,"],
[920,"beware the temptation to retreat from a good thing."],
[926,"If it was right when you prayed about it and trusted it and lived for it, it is right now."],
[933,"Don\u2019t give up when the pressure mounts."],
[936,"You can find an apartment."],
[938,"You can win over your mother-in-law."],
[940,"You can sell your harmonica and therein fund one more meal."],
[947,"It\u2019s been done before."],
[950,"Don\u2019t give in."],
[952,"Certainly don\u2019t give in to that being who is bent on the destruction of your happiness."],
[960,"He wants everyone to be miserable like unto himself."],
[966,"Face your doubts. Master your fears."],
[969,"\u201cCast not away therefore your confidence.\u201d"],
[973,"Stay the course and see the beauty of life unfold for you."],
[981,"To help us make our way through these experiences, these important junctures in our lives, let"],
[988,"me draw from another scriptural reference to Moses."],
[991,"It was given in the early days of this dispensation when revelation was needed, when a true course"],
[998,"was being set and had to be continued."],
[1003,"Virtually everyone in the room knows the formula for revelation given in section 9 of the Doctrine"],
[1010,"and Covenants\u2014you know, the verses about studying it out in your mind and the Lord"],
[1015,"promising to confirm or deny."],
[1018,"What most of us don\u2019t read in conjunction with this is the section that precedes it\u2014section 8."],
[1025,"In that revelation the Lord defined revelation:"],
[1030,"I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you"],
[1040,"and which shall dwell in your heart."],
[1042,"[I love the combination there of both mind and heart."],
[1047,"God will teach us in a reasonable way and in a revelatory way\u2014mind and heart combined,"],
[1054,"by the Holy Ghost.]"],
[1057,"Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit by which Moses"],
[1067,"brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground."],
[1074,"Question: Why would the Lord use the example of crossing the Red Sea as the classic example"],
[1086,"of \u201cthe spirit of revelation\u201d? It&amp;#39;s a classic example of a miracle. But He says it&amp;#39;s the spirit of revelation."],
[1095,"Why didn\u2019t he use the First Vision?"],
[1097,"Or the example from the book of Moses we just used?"],
[1102,"Or the vision of the brother of Jared?"],
[1105,"Well, he could have used any of these, but he didn\u2019t."],
[1110,"Here he had another purpose in mind."],
[1114,"Usually we think of revelation as information."],
[1120,"Just open the books to us, Lord, like: What was the political significance of the Louisiana"],
[1126,"Purchase or the essence of the second law of thermodynamics?"],
[1131,"It is obvious that when you see those kinds of questions on a test paper, you need revelation."],
[1142,"Someone said prayer will never be eliminated from the schools so long as there are final examinations."],
[1150,"But aside from the fact that you probably aren\u2019t going to get that kind of revelation\u2014because"],
[1158,"in this Church we do not believe in ex nihilo creation, especially in exams\u2014this is too"],
[1168,"narrow a concept of revelation."],
[1172,"May I suggest how section 8 broadens our understanding of section 9, particularly in light of these"],
[1182,"\u201cfights of affliction\u201d that Paul spoke of and that I have been discussing."],
[1189,"First of all, revelation almost always comes in response to a question, usually an urgent"],
[1200,"question\u2014not always, but usually."],
[1203,"In that sense it does provide information, but it is urgently needed information, special information."],
[1213,"Moses\u2019 challenge was how to get himself and the children of Israel out of this horrible"],
[1218,"predicament they were in."],
[1222,"There were chariots behind them, sand dunes on every side, and just a lot of water immediately ahead."],
[1229,"He needed information all right\u2014what to do\u2014but it wasn\u2019t a casual thing he was asking."],
[1236,"In this case it was literally a matter of life and death."],
[1240,"You will need information, too, but in matters of great consequence it is not likely to come"],
[1250,"unless you want it urgently, faithfully, humbly."],
[1255,"Moroni calls it seeking \u201cwith real intent\u201d If you can seek that way, and stay in that"],
[1264,"mode, not much that the adversary can counter with will dissuade you from a righteous path."],

[1278,"to\u2014figuratively, at least\u2014see the face of God and live."],

[1308,"The Red Sea will open to the honest seeker of revelation."],
[1315,"The adversary does have power to hedge up the way, to marshal Pharaoh\u2019s forces and"],

[1362,"Lesson number two is closely related to it."],
[1368,"It is that in the process of revelation and in making important decisions, fear almost"],

[1383,"To Oliver Cowdery, who missed the opportunity of a lifetime because he didn\u2019t seize it"],
[1391,"in the lifetime of the opportunity, the Lord said, \u201cYou did not continue as you commenced.\u201d"],

[1454,"For a moment in that confrontation, \u201cMoses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began"],
[1466,"to fear, he saw the bitterness of hell\u201d That\u2019s when you see it\u2014when you are afraid."],
[1478,"That is exactly the problem that beset the children of Israel at the edge of the Red Sea."],
[1483,"That is lesson number two."],
[1484,"It has everything to do with holding fast to earlier illumination."],
[1492,"The record says, \u201cAnd when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their"],
[1499,"eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid.\u201d"],

[1511,"This isn\u2019t worth it."],
[1513,"We must have been wrong."],
[1514,"That probably wasn\u2019t the right spirit telling us to leave Egypt.\u201d"],
